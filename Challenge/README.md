# Bike-Sharing Analysis

Using the Citi Bike data, we looked into answering the following questions about New York City.

1. Who uses them?
2. Where are the bikes mostly used?
3. What time of the day are the bikes mostly used?
4. How long are the bikes being used for?

After analyzing the bike-sharing program in New York City, we will use this data to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To aid with our proposal, we researched Des Moines and created visualizations with Tableau story to present a compelling story.

## Summary

At first New York City seemed to be on the opposite spectrum of Des Moines, however, after looking over the data and comparing the two states, New York City and Des Moines have multiple similarities.
